# CS Club Site

This is the project repo for the official site of the Computer Science Club at
the University of Northwestern - St. Paul. It is created with the following
libraries:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - Main server framework
  - [React](https://react.dev) - Frontend
- [Motion](https://motion.dev) - Animation library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Alternative styling
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) - HTTP server

The site will be used to showcase everyone's projects and endeavors at UNW and
beyond. Everyone gets their own route. There will also eventually be a
slideshow for use inside UNW.
